# What is GitHub?
GitHub is a software development tool used to organize, standardize, and share software development projects from multiple contributors.  It handles important things like version control and contribution permissions.  You can think of GitHub as a software project management tool that keeps Corey from breaking things and helps Virgis build things.    

# Why GitHub for Hargrove?
In their day-to-day projects, many talented, hard-working, and good-looking Hargrove teammates have already created software tools to complete work more efficiently.  However, these tools often lack documentation, are rarely project agnostic, and unless you sit across from the teammate who made them, you probably don't know they exist.  This Hargrove GitHub intends to change those things.

# The Bottom Line (pun intended)
Hargrove's business model lives and dies on competitive bids and effecient project completion. Therefore, supporting teammates by creating a centralized environment that standardizes and professionalizes their valuable ideas is a no-brainer.

# GitHub for Hargrove Scope
1. Act as a central resource for Hargrove software development tools
2. Function as a method of organization and version control for software development projects
3. Encourage internal contributions from all levels within the Hargrove hierarchy
4. Act as an educational resource on how to use Hargrove home-brewed tools
5. Clearly communicate standards on how to contribute to software development projects
